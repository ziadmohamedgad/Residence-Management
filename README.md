# Residences Management System

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
Residences Management System is a C# desktop application designed to manage and track residencies for individuals and employees.  
It records issuance and expiration dates, residency status, and stores related images.  
The system also sends email notifications **15 days before a residency expires**.

---

## âœ¨ Features
- **Residency Management**: Add, edit, delete residency records with full details and images.
- **People & Employee Management**: Maintain records for both individuals and employees.
- **Expiration Tracking**: Automatically detects residencies that are close to expiring.
- **Email Alerts**: Sends notification emails 15 days before expiration.
- **Search & Filtering**: Powerful filtering and search capabilities in multiple forms (People, Employees, Residencies).
- **Layered Architecture**: Separated into Data Layer, Business Layer, and Presentation Layer for better maintainability.
- **Dynamic Image Storage**: Images are stored dynamically based on the projectâ€™s root folder, ensuring portability.
- **Automatic Backups**: Both the SQL database file and residency image files are saved:
  - Inside the project directory.
  - As an additional backup copy on the `C:` drive for extra safety.

## ðŸ’¾ Backup & Storage
- The application ensures data safety by maintaining **two copies** of important files:
  1. **Primary copy**: Stored within the projectâ€™s directory.
  2. **Backup copy**: Automatically saved to a dedicated folder on the `C:` drive after any transaction.
- Files covered by the backup process:
  - **SQL database file**.
  - **Residency image files**.
- Image paths are saved dynamically in the database (relative to the project root), so the application can be easily moved to a different location without breaking links.
